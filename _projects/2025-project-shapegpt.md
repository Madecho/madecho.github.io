This project combines **ShapeGPT** and **PointPainter** for fast zero-shot text-to-3D point cloud generation, with optional colorization.

You can add a local GIF to showcase the pipeline or results. Place your GIF in `assets/img/` (e.g. `shapegpt_demo.gif`) and it will display below.

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
  <div class="col-sm-10 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/projects/ShapeGPT.png" title="ShapeGPT and PointPainter demo" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" loading="eager" avoid_scaling=true %}
  </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
  Replace <code>assets/img/projects/ShapeGPT.png</code> with your own GIF path once the file is in place.
</div>
