I am currently a Lecturer at [Jiangxi University of Software Professional Technology](https://www.jxuspt.com/). Previously, I obtained my Master's degree in Computer Science from [Nanchang University](http://www.ncu.edu.cn/), where I was advised by [Prof. Jingbo Wei](https://teacher.ncu.edu.cn/publish/wjb/index.html). I hold a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering from [Jiangxi University of Finance and Economics](http://www.jxufe.edu.cn/).

My research interests lie at the intersection of **3D Vision** and **AI**, specifically focusing on **3D Reconstruction**, **Point-Cloud Processing**, and **Generative AI**.
